# Building a Full Stack React Application

Hello! This is the repo meant to accompany my Lynda.com video class Building A Full Stack React Application.

This course is intended for people who have a familiarity with full stack web development and react but are having a bit of trouble putting all of the pieces together.

If you're coming from Lynda, navigate through the repo branches to find the correct resources for each video. You can also consult the project table of contents.

 * HTML and CSS
 * javascript

And things will be easier if you're familiar with:

  * webpack
  * express
  * sql
  * git

You should also have:
  * an IDE installed
  * a recent version of node
  * a local version of postgres
