# Chapter 2: Brainstorming

I imagine you already have a bunch of great ideas for web applications. But for this course, since I'm leading it, we get to build one of mine!

I encourage you to follow along my way the first time and then, once you're finished, go back later and try to adapt my techniques in order to make your own application.

And one last word to the wise before I describe the application we're going to be working on. If you do choose to build your own application, remember: keep it simple! Develop and then iterate.

Focus on building that Minimum Viable Product. When you think of a good feature, take a second to write it down.

Alright, without further ado, here is the application I've been meaning to build.

I call the application TicTacTuring.

I've always been interested in Alan Turing's ideas about AI and the Turing Test and I thought it would be fun to make a game where part of the challenge is determining whether or not your opponent is really an Artificial Intelligence impostor!

Now, if you listened to what I said earlier about keeping things simple, you should already be on high alert to the risk of feature creep. Multiplayer? Machine Learning? Those are all complicated things to implement!

 But don't worry! We are going to take things easy. At its core, our app is  going to have two views: a profile and an arena.

 And, to make things slightly easier for our MVP, we're not even going to worry about letting players play against other players, or for that matter, a real AI.

Our app's central functionality will revolve around the users ability to play TicTacToe against a mystery opponent and then to guess at their opponent's identity identity.
