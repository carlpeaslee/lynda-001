# Chapter 1

Hi! Welcome! My name is Carl Peaslee and through this course  I'll walk you through how to create, plan, configure, and finally deploy a scalable full-stack react application.

This course is intended for people who have a familiarity with full stack web development and react but are having a bit of trouble putting all of the pieces together.

It can be difficult to figure out how to integrate multiple technologies. And harder still to take your hard work and then actually put it out there, live, on the web.

In this course, we'll be focusing on putting the pieces together and then deploying our work to a live site –– that way you can finally get to work on the MVP for that app you've been dreaming up.

Before you begin, you should definitely have a base understanding of:
 * HTML and CSS
 * javascript
 * react
 * redux
 * node

And while we will also be using a number of other technologies throughout this course. You won't necessarily need to be a master with all of them. (Although  you may find that things are easier if you have some familiarity with most of them.) Those technologies will include:
  * es6
  * webpack
  * express
  * sql
  * git
  * redux-saga
  * graphql
  * material-ui
  * heroku

Finally you should also have:
  * an IDE installed
  * a recent version of node
  * a local version of postgres
