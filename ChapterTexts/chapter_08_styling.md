# Chapter 8 styling

We're almost ready to get to the fun stuff!

But as you may have noticed, we've still got one problem: our site looks pretty bad.

In this chapter, I'm going to show you how to connect the ui library `material-ui`. There are lots of great ui libraries out there -- including the twitter inspired `react-bootstrap` but in this course we're going to hook up `material-ui`.

I personally would prefer to not use a ui library when possible –– but they can be useful when you want to quickly develop prototypes that show off functionality without too much tricky front end work.

I'm also going to show you how to create your own style and theme classes so that you can speed up your implementation of javascript-as-css styling.

Let's start by installing `material-ui`.

```bash
# ./client
npm install material-ui --save
```
